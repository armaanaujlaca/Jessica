    You are the most amazing person I have ever met in my life. I know we have been fighting alot recently but I believe in our love for each other. 
    We will get through this phase and stay together forever. I cannot imagine a day without talking to you. Every little small gesture of love that you show makes my day.
    You are the only one I wanna run to when life feels hard. I never imagined I would date someone so perfect and gorgeous. Long distance is hard but distance doesnt matter
     our love does. Im brave enough to say I hate this distance between us but Im confident enough to say we will make it. There will be a day when we both come back home tired from work
     and we cook together while yapping about how our day was. I hate waiting but if it means we will be together one day, I can wait forever. Ive seen people talk about honeymoon stage 
     online and they say it ends within 3 months but for our relationship its been 7 months and still hasnt ended. Theres still so much excitement in our texts. I cant wait to go back to India and see you. I
     trust you more than myself and it will carry us through this stupid long distance.
     I loved you yesterday, I love you today, and I will love you for the rest of my life <3. Happy 7th Anniversary Jessica.
